To enable the debug symbols in the executable we can use -ggdb.
    Ex:- gcc <input.c> -ggdb -o <exe-name>
To run the executable with the gdb
    Ex:- gdb ./<Executable-name>

/******************* < 'list' command usage > *************/ 
To print lines from a source file, use the list command (abbreviated l). By default, 
ten lines are printed. There are several ways to specify what part of the file you 
want to print.

Here are the forms of the list command most commonly used:

list linenum
    Print lines centered around line number linenum in the current source file.
list function
    Print lines centered around the beginning of function function.
list
    Print more lines. If the last lines printed were printed with a list command, 
    this prints lines following the last lines printed; however, if the last line 
    printed was a solitary line printed as part of displaying a stack frame.
list -
    Print lines just before the lines last printed.
    By default, GDB prints ten source lines with any of these forms of the list 
    command. You can change this using set listsize:

set listsize count
    Make the list command display count source lines (unless the list argument explicitly 
    specifies some other number).
show listsize
    Display the number of lines that list prints.
    Repeating a list command with RET discards the argument, so it is equivalent to 
    typing just list. This is more useful than listing the same lines again. 
    An exception is made for an argument of `-'; that argument is preserved in 
    repetition so that each repetition moves up in the source file.

In general, the list command expects you to supply zero, one or two linespecs. Linespecs specify source lines; 
there are several ways of writing them, but the effect is always to specify some source line. 
Here is a complete description of the possible arguments for list:

list linespec
    Print lines centered around the line specified by linespec.
list first,last
    Print lines from first to last. Both arguments are linespecs.
list ,last
    Print lines ending with last.
list first,
    Print lines starting with first.
list +
    Print lines just after the lines last printed.
list -
    Print lines just before the lines last printed.

IMPORTENT :- 
    List command is useful only when source code is exists, if you rename the source code and try to run the 
    souce code with gdb, where the list command gives Error.  

/************************** < 'info' command usage > ***********************/ 
To list all the features supported by info , we can use "(gbd) info <ENTER>"
info functions 
    list all the functions, both debug and non debug functions.  
info sources 
   Source files for which symbols will be read in on demand:
info variables 
   It does not print any local variables, It prints global and static variables only.  
info scope <double-tab> 
    List all the available scopes. 
    
-- To Extract only debug symbols from Executable, 
        Ex:- objcopy --only-keep-debug <rip from binary> <output debug file> 

-- To strip the debugging symbols from Executables 
        Ex :  strip --strip-debug <Executable-file>
              strip --strip-debug --strip-unneeded <Executable-file>
                    strip everything which is not required to run the binary. 

Adding Debug Symbols to Binary :-
    2 ways :-
        1. Load the symbol file within GDB 
              - symbol-file file_name
        2. Add it in the Binay itself 
              - objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=debug_symbolfile exeBinaryFile
